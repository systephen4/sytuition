              >August 2019: With aspirations to pursue a career in Engineering,
              I intended to choose Maths, Physics, and Engineering as my A-level
              subjects. Unfortunately, my application for Maths and Physics was
              denied, as I did not meet the required grades - 6s in Maths and
              Combined Sciences. As an alternative, I opted for A-levels in
              Italian and Design Engineering and a BTEC Diploma in Applied
              Sciences, equivalent to two A-levels.

              >September 2020: After devoting an academic year to studying these
              subjects, I came to the realization that I was not fulfilling my
              potential. I became dissatisfied with my chosen subjects, knowing
              that they would likely present an obstacle in my pursuit of higher
              education in Engineering. Recognizing the importance of studying
              Physics to increase my chances of pursuing my desired carrer path,
              I made a dedicated commitment to independently study A-level
              Physics in my spare time. As I delved into the subject, my passion
              for Physics grew exponentially, leading me to shift my goals from
              pursuing an Engineering degree to aiming for a degree in Physics
              instead. This change in direction reflected my newfound enthusiasm
              and determination to fully explore and excel in the field of
              Physics.

              >October 2020: Despite facing significant opposition due to my
              lower GCSE grades, I remained determined to pursue A-level Physics
              and include it in my timetable. However, this path was not without
              its challenges. To address the concerns surrounding my GCSE Maths
              grade, I was advised to retake the exam and achieve a 6 or above.
              Fueled by my determination, I embarked on a rigorous journey of
              independent study for GCSE Maths, devoting myself entirely to the
              subject for one month. During this intensive period, I committed
              to understanding the material thoroughly and honing my
              mathematical skills to meet the required standard.

              discovered that my passion for mathematics had grown even more.
              Fueled by this newfound enthusiasm, I took the initiative to
              independently study A-level Maths alongside my other subjects,
              including Italian, Design Engineering, and the BTEC Diploma in
              Applied Sciences. Balancing these commitments, I also continued my
              independent study of A-level Physics.

              >January 2021: On results day, I was thrilled to discover that I
              had achieved a grade 8. However, my journey to pursue A-level
              Physics did not end there. I was informed that in order to secure
              a place, I needed to sit an entrance test in Physics in February
              2021, and if I could attain a C grade in that test, I would be
              admitted into the course. However, as Physics A-level typically
              spans two years, joining the course meant I would have to stay an
              extra year in education. Initially, I felt hesitant about this
              extended commitment, but my passion for Physics ultimately
              overpowered my concerns. I decided to follow my vision and pursue
              Physics wholeheartedly. Recognizing the level of dedication
              required, I made a difficult decision to drop from the BTEC
              Diploma (which consisted of two qualifications) to the BTEC
              Extended Certificate (a single qualification) to create more time
              and focus for my Physics studies. My dedication paid off, as I
              completed the BTEC Extended Certificate program much earlier than
              intended, finishing in January 2021. This meant that in a
              remarkable feat, I had effectively completed an equivalent A-level
              qualification in just five academic months, spanning from
              September 2020 to January 2021.

              As a result, I was granted admission to the 2022 class for A-level
              Physics. However, my journey didn't end there. Due to my
              commendable performance in the GCSE Maths resit, I was advised to
              consider adding A-level Maths to my curriculum. Recognizing the
              importance of Maths in the field of Physics and heeding the
              advice, I took on the challenge and was given a conditional offer
              for A-level Maths, with a requirement to sit the test in March.</a

              >March 2021: Having covered the AS level maths syllabus at that
              point in under 4 months, which aligns with the material covered by
              the 2022 A-level maths class from September to March, I felt
              well-prepared for the test and passed with outstanding results. My
              passion for knowledge drove me to pursue Further Maths
              independetly. I then made a request to include further maths in my
              curriculum. However, despite my eagerness, I encountered
              significant opposition, and unfortunately, I was denied entry. The
              reason cited was that the 2022 class was already significantly
              ahead in the further maths curriculum. Consequently, I had to
              temporarily abandon my self-studying efforts in further maths,
              dbecause the workload from my other subjects demanded my full
              attention.

              department to offer me an opportunity due to recognizing my
              abilities and acknowledging the advantage it would bring to my
              Cambridge application to have Further Maths. Consequently, I
              received the news that I would be required to sit an admissions
              test in September, which meant I had to dedicate my summer of 2021
              to revising the entire AS Further Maths content. This intense
              preparation period was necessary to ensure I could showcase my
              proficiency for the subject.

              >September 2021: Despite not being able to cover the entire
              Further Maths syllabus during the summer, I took the Further Maths
              test, feeling uncertain about my preparation. Surprisingly, I
              managed to pass the test, granting me admission to the Further
              Maths class. This accomplishment was a testament to my
              determination and ability to excel even under challenging
              circumstances. Alongside this, I had already submitted my UCAS
              application, and I began preparing for the NSAA (Cambridge Natural
              Sciences Admissions Assessment). However, I must admit that my
              preparation for the NSAA was not as thorough as I would have
              liked. Balancing my other A-levels and trying to catch up on the
              Further Maths content took precedence, leaving limited time and
              focus for NSAA revision. As a result, my NSAA preparation was
              somewhat mediocre at best. I didn't allocate enough time for
              revision, and I couldn't dedicate as much effort as I would have
              preferred. Nevertheless, I remained determined to give it my best
              shot, knowing that my overall academic achievements and passion
              for the subjects could still make a positive impact on my
              Cambridge application.

              >Janurary 2022: After receiving feedback from Cambridge, I learned
              that I was rejected post-interview. The interview process was
              divided into two parts, and my performance had varying outcomes.
              Unfortunately, I struggled during the first part due to the
              pressure, anxiety, and a lack of preparation in specific Physics
              topics, including Simple Harmonic Motion, which hadn't been
              covered in my Physics class yet. On a more positive note, the
              second part of the interview went quite well for me. The questions
              were centered around maths, an area where I've always been
              stronger, and I was able to excel in this aspect of the
              assessment. However, the feedback also revealed that my
              performance on the NSAA didn't meet the expected standard, which,
              combined with the interview results, led to my rejection. It was a
              disheartening experience, and I felt quite gutted and disappointed
              in myself. Despite the emotional challenges, I found the strength
              to push through this setback.

              >Following the setback and the lack of motivation it brought, my
              performance in the final mock exams was impacted. I managed to
              achieve A*BB grades in Maths, Physics, and Further Maths. However,
              I was still struggling to catch up in Further Maths, which
              reflected in my grades. Given my grades and the advice of my
              teachers, they suggested that I put Durham as my firm choice in
              UCAS. The reasoning was that I needed to improve my Physics grade
              to an A to meet Durham's requirements, which seemed more
              achievable. On the other hand, they deemed Imperial to be more
              risky due to the significant improvement required. To meet
              Imperial's requirements, I needed to achieve an A* in Physics and
              an A in Further Maths. Despite their suggestion, I decided to go
              against the grain and made Imperial my firm choice. I had the
              belief in my abilities and was determined to achieve those grades.
              Although my teachers warned that nobody in our school had achieved
              an A* in A-Level Physics since 2011, I remained confident in my
              potential and was not willing to settle for less.</a

              performance in Maths and Further Maths, I felt disappointed that I
              hadn't achieved the A in Physics that I had hoped for. I was aware
              that no one in our class had managed to secure the A* in Physics,
              making the outcome even more disheartening. However, despite not
              attaining the A* grade, I received the fantastic news that I had
              been accepted at Imperial College. I couldn't help but feel

              and challenging the admission process can be.
