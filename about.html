        <h1>Meet the founder.</h1>
        <p>
          Introducing Stephen Mensah, the founder of ShapeYourTuition. Stephen
          is currently a first-year Physics undergraduate student at Imperial
          College London, which holds an impressive 6th place in the 2023 QS
          World University Rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stephen's academic prowess shines through with an outstanding
          achievement of 6 A-level (or equivalent) qualifications, earning
          A*A*A*AA and a Distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remarkably, Stephen achieved the highest scores in his cohort at St.
          Paul's Catholic School in Milton Keynes for Mathematics and Further
          Mathematics A-Levels. It's noteworthy that he completed Further Maths
          in less than one academic year, further amplifying this impressive
          achievement. Recognised as the top-achiever for A-levels in both 2021
          and 2022 combined at his secondary school.
        </p>
        <p>
          His burning desire for the pursuit of knowledge in education and
          academics, paired with his eagerness to assist others, drew him closer
          to the world of teaching, where he can now share his passion and
          enthusiasm while helping others along the way.

      <h1>Testimonial from Stephen's mentor.</h1>
      <!-- <div class="box"> -->
      <p>
        Stephen is an inspirational student who has had a unique academic
        journey through our school which is a large urban comprehensive, with a
        higher than average deprivation indicator, situated in Milton Keynes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen always enjoys discovering more about topics studied in depth and
        translating these into his own ideas and understanding. Stephen is a
        risk taker. He has demonstrated a keen understanding in learning new
        concepts and has the ability to link what he has learnt with knowledge
        and skills he has already acquired. When faced with difficulties,
        Stephen perseveres and works with detail and enthusiasm, always aiming
        to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stephen is a tenacious student who has had to overcome significant
        barriers. He has proven time and time again that, when given an
        opportunity, he grasps it with both hands. His gratitude for learning
        opportunities is humbling and he is an absolute delight to work with.
